        <h2>Projects:</h2>
        <p>Object Detection
My project involved implementing an object detection system using artificial intelligence and deep
learning technology. I utilized the YOLOv3 model, which is renowned for its accuracy and efficiency
in object detection. The project encompassed loading the YOLOv3 weights and configuration, and I
employed the OpenCV library to extract object class name
House Prediction
This project involves data preprocessing and cleaning of a dataset containing information about houses
in Bengaluru, India. The goal seems to be preparing the dataset for further analysis and possibly
machine learning modeling
Tesla Stock Prediction
I developed a stock price prediction project using artificial intelligence and deep learning techniques.
The project involved analyzing and processing time series data for stock prices using libraries like
pandas and numpy, and building an LSTM model using Keras to forecast future stock prices.
Black Friday Analysis
In this project, I conducted an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python's pandas,
numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and other libraries. The project aimed to analyze a dataset related to Black
Friday sales and gain insights into customer behavior and purchase patterns.
Tic Tac Toe
Developed a command-line Tic-Tac-Toe game using Python, demonstrating proficiency in problemsolving and algorithmic thinking. The game was built to allow two players to engage in a classic game
of Tic-Tac-Toe, following standard rules and gameplay</p>
